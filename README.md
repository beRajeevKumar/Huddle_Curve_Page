- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<picture>
  <source
    media="(max-width: 48em)"
    srcset="./images/bg-section-top-mobile-1.svg"
    type="image/svg+xml"
  />
  <source srcset="./images/bg-section-top-desktop-1.svg" type="image/svg+xml" />
  <img
    class="bg-shape-img"
    src="./images/bg-section-top-desktop-1.svg"
    alt="Background Top Shape 01"
  />
</picture>
```

```css
:root {
  --pink: hsl(322, 100%, 66%);
  --light-pink: hsl(321, 100%, 78%);
  --light-red: hsl(0, 100%, 63%);

  --very-dark-cyan: hsl(192, 100%, 9%);
  --light-grayish-cyan: hsl(208, 11%, 55%);
  --very-pale-blue: hsl(207, 100%, 98%);
}
```

### Continued development

I will continue to focus on improving my CSS skills and learn more about CSS Grid and Flexbox. I will also focus on learning JavaScript to make my projects more interactive.
